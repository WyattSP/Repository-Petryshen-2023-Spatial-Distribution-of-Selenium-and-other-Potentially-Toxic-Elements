 Supplementary information including code, data, shapefiles, and report for the study are included within this repository.

 The provided code was run in R Studio (RStudio Team, 2020; Version 2022.02.0 Build 443) running R Software (R Core Team 2021; Version 4.1.2).

 Data processing and analysis was run with the following R code:
 1) Code - Processing, Cleaning, and Summary Statistics.R
 2) Code - Contamination Factor.R
 3) Code - Generalized Additive Models.R
 4) Code - Map Plots.R
 5) Code - Original Sample Site Boxplots.R

 Full Datasets are included in the Publication_Data.xlsx file within the Publication Data Folder. The 'Original Data' sheet is the initial import in the data analysis and is duplicated from the ALS lab reports which are titled "ALS Report".

 Data outputs from each R script is included in the CSV Files of R Exports folder:
 * Cleaned Moss Data.csv
 * Summary_Statistics.csv
 * Summary_Statistics_No_11.csv
 * Contamination Factor Data.csv
 * Gam Results.csv

 Shape files used in Code - Map Plots.R can be found in the Shapefiles folder. The centroid locations for the Elkview Mine, the Line Creek Coal Processing Plant, and the Line Creek Mine were calculated in QGIS from these shapefiles. Centorid location shapefiles are also included in this folder.

 Shapefiles folder:
 * Elkview Mine Shapefile
 * Line Creek Processing Plant Shapefile
 * Line Creek Mine Shapefile
 * Elkview Mine Centroid
 * Line Creek Processing Plant Centroid
